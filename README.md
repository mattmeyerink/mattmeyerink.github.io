# Personal Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website. It discusses my complete side projects, tells a little bit about who I am, and contains many pictures doing my favorite hobbies with my favorite people!

This site is currently built using HTML running on my personal domain managed with Google Domains served by github.
